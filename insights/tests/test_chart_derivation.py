"""Does a chart's config derive the query the chart is meant to draw?

Every chart type has a case here, and a type with no case is a failure — this
is the only place that says what a config turns into, so a new chart type is
undrawable until it lands in `chart_derivation_fixtures`.

The cases used to be diffed against the queries the browser derived and the
shipped workbooks carried. That check did its job: the port matched, chart for
chart, so the browser's output was written into the fixtures and the caches it
came from are gone.

Read `insights/insights/doctype/insights_chart_v3/chart_query.py` for what is
being derived.
