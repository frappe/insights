## Frappe Insights
Insights is a 100% open-source BI tool designed to make data analysis and reporting more accessible to technical as well as non-technical users.


## Motivation
Building custom apps or creating structured data has been very easy with Frappe Framework. However, extracting information from these apps was not a very good experience. Users needed to know how to write SQL queries to create reports to gain valuable information from the data. So I wanted to improve the experience of building these reports and dashboards for everyone in our team. 

## Key Features

- **Connect Multiple Sources**: You can integrate data from multiple databases, files and spreadsheets. Getting all your data into one place helps you analyse interconnected data.

- **Query Builder**: Frappe Insights a user-friendly query builder interface that allows users to create queries without any SQL knowledge. The interface provides a step-by-step approach for building queries, empowering users to easily select tables, add joins, apply filters, perform calculations, and more.

- **Visualizations and Dashboards**: You can visualize the query results using a variety of charts and graphs. Frappe Insights also suggests the best chart for a given result set. You can create dashboards using a drag-and-drop interface and add filters on the dashboard to apply to the charts.

- **Database Support**: Frappe Insights currently supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, DuckDB, and BigQuery databases. More database integrations are planned for the future.

## Under the Hood

- [**Frappe Framework**](https://github.com/frappe/frappe): Frappe Insights is built upon the Frappe Framework, a full-stack web application framework written in Python and Javascript. The framework provides a robust foundation for building web applications, including a database abstraction layer, user authentication, and a REST API.

- [**Frappe UI**](https://github.com/frappe/frappe-ui): Frappe Insights uses Frappe UI, a Vue-based UI library, to provide a modern user interface. The Frappe UI library provides a variety of components that can be used to build single-page applications on top of the Frappe Framework.

- [**SQLAlchemy**](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy): Frappe Insights uses SQLAlchemy, a Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper, to interact with the database. SQLAlchemy provides a powerful and flexible interface for working with databases, allowing Frappe Insights to support multiple database integrations.

- [**eCharts**](https://github.com/apache/echarts): Frappe Insights uses eCharts, a powerful open-source charting and visualization library, to render charts and graphs. eCharts provides a variety of chart types and customization options, allowing Frappe Insights to provide a rich and interactive data visualization experience.
